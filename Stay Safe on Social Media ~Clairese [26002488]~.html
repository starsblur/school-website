<p>Social media is a big part of daily life, but it‚Äôs also a prime target for scammers, identity thieves, and malicious actors. Nowadays, with so many online risks from phishing to identity theft it‚Äôs more important than ever to protect your privacy by following a few simple cybersecurity practices.</p>
<h2><b> Learn simple steps to keep your personal information safe and secure.</b> </h2>
Which, of course, I‚Äôm going to help you with by sharing some simple steps you should take to stay safe!</p>

<p>Here are some key safety practices:
<ol>
<li>Use strong, unique passwords</li>
<li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)</li>
<li>Review privacy settings</li>
<li>Be cautious with links and attachments</li>
<li>Think before you share</li>
<li>Watch out for fake accounts</li>
</ol></p>

<br>

<h3><b>The use of strong & unique passwords </b></h3>
<p>Choose long, complex passwords that are unique for each account. Avoid using easily guessable info like birthdays or common words. A password manager can help you create and store strong passwords securely. This <b>lowers</b> the risk of hackers accessing your accounts through weak or reused passwords.</p>

<p>Recommended password managers:
  <ul>
    <li>LastPass</li>
    <li>1Password</li>
    <li>Bitwarden</li>
    <li>Dashlane</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<br>

<h3><b>Turn On Two-Factor Authentication </b></h3>
<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an <b>extra layer</b> of security to your account by requiring a second form of verification like a code sent to your phone or an authentication app on top of your password. Even if someone gets hold of your password, they won‚Äôt be able to access your account without this second step.</p>

<p>Popular 2FA apps:
<ul>
<li>Google Authenticator</li>
<li>Authy</li>
<li>Microsoft Authenticator</li>
<li>Duo Mobile</li>
</ul></p>

<br>

<h3><b>Check Your Privacy Settings</b></h3>
<p><b>Regularly</b> check and update your social media privacy settings to control who can see your posts and personal information. Limit what strangers can view by making your profile private or restricting certain details to friends only. This reduces the risk of unwanted attention, data scraping, or misuse of your personal info.</p>

<br>

<h3><b>Stay Alert for Suspicious Links</b></h3>
<p>Scammers often use links and attachments to spread malware or steal your personal information through phishing attacks. <b>Be wary of unexpected messages or DMs</b> even if they seem to come from friends and avoid clicking on unknown or suspicious links. When in doubt, <b>verify</b> with the sender before opening anything. You can also check if a link is safe by pasting it into a trusted link-scanning website, like <a href="https://nordvpn.com/link-checker/">NordVPN checker </a> or Google Safe Browsing.</p>

<br>

<h3><b>Be Mindful of What You Share</b></h3>
<p>Be mindful of the personal information you share on social media. Details like your location, birthday, school, or daily routines can be used by scammers for social engineering or identity theft. <b>Before posting,</b> consider who can see it and whether it‚Äôs really necessary to share. Keeping some information private helps protect you from targeted attacks.</p>

<br>

<h3><b>Be Aware of Impersonators</b></h3>
<p>Scammers often create fake profiles to impersonate friends, celebrities, or brands and trick you into sharing personal information or clicking malicious links. <b>Be cautious</b> with friend requests or messages from people you don‚Äôt know well, and look for signs of a fake account like few photos, generic bios, or strange behavior. <b>When in doubt, verify their identity before engaging.</b></p>
